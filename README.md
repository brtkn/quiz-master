This is a React project that utilizes the Trivia API to create an interactive quiz application. It makes use of React hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, for state management and handling side effects.

## Features

- The application consists of a cover page that provides an introduction.
- Upon clicking a button, the user is taken to the quiz section.
- In the quiz section, the application fetches trivia questions from the Trivia API and displays them along with multiple answer options.
- Users can select an answer, which is stored in the component's state.
- When the user clicks the "Check Answers" button, the application compares the selected answers with the correct answers and displays the results, showing the number of correct answers out of the total questions.
- There's also a "New Set" button that allows users to fetch a new set of questions from the API, updating the quiz with fresh data.
